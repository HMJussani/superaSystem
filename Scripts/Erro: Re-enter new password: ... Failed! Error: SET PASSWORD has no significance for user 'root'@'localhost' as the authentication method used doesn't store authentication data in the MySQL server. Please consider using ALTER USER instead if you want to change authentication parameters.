Re-enter new password: ... Failed! Error: SET PASSWORD has no significance for user 'root'@'localhost' as the authentication method used doesn't store authentication data in the MySQL server. Please consider using ALTER USER instead if you want to change authentication parameters:
1- Open the terminal application.
2- Terminate the mysql_secure_installation from another terminal using the killall command:
3- sudo killall -9 mysql_secure_installation
4- Start the mysql client:
   sudo mysql
5- Run the following SQL query:
  ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'root';
  exit;
6- Then run the following command to secure it:
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
7- When promoted for the password enter the SetRootPasswordHere (or whatever you set when you ran the above SQL query)
8 -That is all.
